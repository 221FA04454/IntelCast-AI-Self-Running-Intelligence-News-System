    "script": "[0:00 - THE HOOK]\nReporter: \"The race for the Arctic just hit a turning point. At Davos 2026, the U.S. has officially traded tariff threats for a new strategic framework in Greenland. But is this a mission for resources, or a shield against rising eastern influence?\"\n\n[0:15 - CONTEXT INTRODUCTION]\nReporter: \"Welcome to the Global Intelligence Brief. This week, we are witnessing a fundamental realignment of diplomatic power. From the shifting ice of the Arctic to a newly proposed governance model for Gaza, the old rules of engagement are being rewritten. I’m your correspondent, and today we dive deep into the verified facts and the geopolitical ripple effects.\"\n\n[1:00 - EVENT BREAKDOWN: THE GREENLAND FRAMEWORK]\nReporter: \"First, the headlines from Davos. President Donald Trump has announced a 'framework of a future deal' for Greenland. This marks a significant reversal after weeks of tariff threats against Denmark. The deal focuses on two major pillars: secured access to Greenland’s vast critical mineral reserves and the installation of an advanced 'Golden Dome' missile defense system. While Denmark remains the sovereign authority, the framework allows for a shared security umbrella that effectively closes the Arctic gap.\"\n\n[2:30 - EVENT BREAKDOWN: THE BOARD OF PEACE]\nReporter: \"In the Middle East, the diplomatic map is also changing. Eight Muslim-majority nations, including Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Egypt, have released a joint statement agreeing to join the U.S.-led 'Board of Peace.' This transitional body is designed to oversee the reconstruction of Gaza. However, it’s not without friction—some European nations have declined the invitation, citing concerns over the body potentially rivaling the United Nations.\"\n\n[4:00 - GEOPOLITICAL ANALYSIS]\nReporter: \"Why now? These moves represent a pivot toward 'Transactional Security.' By de-escalating trade wars and focusing on localized defense boards, the U.S. is seeking to create alternative pillars of stability outside of traditional UN frameworks. It is a move to consolidate western influence in the Arctic and the Levant simultaneously.\"\n\n[5:30 - COUNTRY IMPACTS]\nReporter: \"The impact is global. For the USA, it’s about supply chain security and keeping Russia and China out of the Arctic. For INDIA, the 'Board of Peace' invitation offers a permanent seat at a high-visibility table, though at a significant financial cost. CHINA and RUSSIA are watching closely—Russia has expressed wariness over the militarization of the Arctic, while China continues to search for its own entry point into the 'Polar Silk Road.'\"\n\n[7:00 - WORLD NEWS: JUSTICE & TECH]\nReporter: \"Briefly elsewhere: In South Korea, justice has been served as former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo was sentenced to 23 years for his role in the 2024 martial law attempt. In the UK, the House of Lords has backed a landmark ban on social media for children under 16, signaling a major regulatory shift in digital protection.\"\n\n[8:30 - FUTURE PREDICTIONS]\nReporter: \"Looking ahead, expect the 'Greenland Framework' to trigger a massive surge in Arctic mining investment by late 2026. In the Middle East, the success of the 'Board of Peace' will depend entirely on whether the $1 billion membership fees can be converted into actual ground-level stability in Gaza.\"\n\n[9:30 - CLOSING CALL-TO-ACTION]\nReporter: \"The world is moving faster than ever.
